# HabitHub Frontend

WIP URL: https://habithub-frontend.netlify.app/ 

Final URL: https://habithub-app.netlify.app/ 

### Sample Credentials

Email: mack@watts.com.au  
Password: mack1234

NOTE: that there are a few habits which have been pre-set as completed (for display purposes), but 'uncompleting' these habits will remove the preset and they will thereafter behave like any other habit - that is, the streak will reset the next day.

Also, this account won't allow you to test the password reset functionality, since it is not a real email address.
