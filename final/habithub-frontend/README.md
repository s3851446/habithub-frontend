# Additional ideation outlined in A1 wireframes

Login

- Image or gif from the website or a small animation of the website with a skeletal look, or a quote that describes the website/app.
  Status: ✅ as per mockups in A1.

Sign up

- The login button will enlarge upon hover to indicate that affords being clicked
  Status: ✅

Guide page

- Sticky header.
  Status: ❌ as it was making the viewport space less and was a distraction for users. Users didn't need to view the header with the header with their profile picture as this is not the main navigation.
- Upon hover, the icons will show a tooltip to let the user know what they represent.
  Status: ✅ instead of tooltips, we made the navbar expandable.
- Images or GIFs will let the user know how to use the app.
  Status: ✅ used videos hosted via YouTube.

Dashboard

- The arrow next to each habit will move slightly to the right upon hover from the user to show that the card can be dragged towards the right to complete. The user can also drag it to the left or edit or delete the habit.
  Status: ❌ users can edit and delete habits, but UI for this is different than described above. The dashboard habit card isn't draggable, so the hover effect on the arrow was not added.
- The user can click the Add Habit button to add a new habit. The button will enlarge upon hover to indicate that it affords being clicked.
  Status: ✅

Settings

- In the profile settings section, the user will be able to change all of their personal settings. By clicking on "change password", a new page or pop-up will open to allow the user to enter their current password and replace it with a new one.
  Status: ❌ edit profile feature was implemented but the option to change password isn't provided. Instead on the login page, we have a "forgot password?" link that allows users to reset their passwords.
- Each habit can have individual notification settings applied to it, depending on the frequency, forgettability, or urgency of each habit.
  Status: ❌ This was a little out outside the skill-set of the members of The WebDevs and we did'nt have enough time to be able to learn how to do this.

Statistics

- Progress bars indicate how far into each streak the user is. The end goal is defined by the user, depending on how many times in a row they want to achieve their habit.
  Status: ✅ implemented as per mockups. Mockups didn't have progress bars.

Habits

- Clicking the ‘edit’ and ‘delete buttons opens a pop-up window.
  Status: ✅
- The pop-up window is animated, dropping from the top of the screen and fixating in the middle, allowing the user to edit the contents of the card, or confirm whether they want to delete the card or not.
  Status: ✅
- Extra space on the right will be utilised to add some sort of animation to make the web app seem interactive and alive.
  Status: ✅
